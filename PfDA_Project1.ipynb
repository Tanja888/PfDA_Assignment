    "For this project we chose **Quality of Life** dataset by O.Karaman retreived from Kaggle platform.[[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orhankaramancode/city-quality-of-life-dataset) Data were acquired from Teleport.org and contain scores on different variables about the life in the cities around the world allowing users to compare them in order to ease the decision of choosing a place to live. [[2]](https://teleport.org/about-us/)    \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the analysis, we didn't use the entire dataset, instead we picked some of the variables we found the most interesting and explored the relationship between them. Initially, eight variables were chosen: Name of the City, Country, Continent and scores variables: Business Freedom, Safety, Education, Economy and Tolerance. The idea was to see how the Tolerance scores vary depending on the other scores variables but the correlation between them turned out to be low which made data generating more difficult. The choice of the variables was changed after we checked the correlation for the whole dataset. New variables that were analysed are: **City, Country, Continent, Housing, Cost of Living, Business Freedom and Education**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To describe what scores **variables** are representing we took a look behind data at Teleport.org:[[3]](https://teleport.org/cities/dublin/)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Housing** included prices of the apartments and rent index,  \n",
    "**Cost of Living** referred to groceries and transport expenses as well as the inflation score,   \n",
    "**Business Freedom** implied freedom from corruption and labor restrictions,  \n",
    "**Education** referred to PISA ranking, happiness of the students and university quality "
