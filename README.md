### Programming for Data Analysis Project 1

### About the Project
The purpose of this project is to gain knowledge in creating a synthesised dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon using numpy.random package in Python and implementing it in a Jupyter notebook. The minimum requirement for the dataset is one-hundred data points over four variables. 

### Project plan
- [x] Choose the dataset
- [ ] Explore the dataset and explain what is going to be analysed
- [x] Import file
- [ ] Clean data
        [ ] which variables to drop
        [ ] explain why keeping certain variables
        [ ] change the names
        - [ ] decide on a size of the sample
        - [ ] group by continents
- [ ] Do statistics, analyse and compare variables
- [ ] Generate a new dataset using numpy.random package - synthesise data
- [ ] Check references
- [ ] Readme file - explain what is in the repository, how to run everything and put snippets of code
- [ ] Jupyter notebook - include references, images, links, code and plots
